<h1>DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 7</h1>

I found this tutorial to be very bad. It was not informative at all and didn't really explain a lot. I had lots of trouble importing rabbitmq into my 
project and running it. And when it finally did work and I had done 2/4 assignments, and then I continued two days later RabbitMQ suddenly didnt want to start
and I had to download it again from homebrew?? So I spent more time on fixing technical installation issues than actually the tutorial. Other than that I didnt
have any technical issues. I have none pending issues.
