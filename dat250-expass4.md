<h1>DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 4</h1>

<h2>Experiment 1: Spark/Java Framework project and Postman</h2>
For this experiment I used the IDE Eclipse. I've used IntelliJ in the other assignments, but for some reason the program wouldn't run in IntelliJ, and I didn't feel like spending lots of time dealing with error messages so I used eclipse instead.
<br>I quickly discovered the Desktop Agent in Postman didn't work with safari so I switched to chrome. This experiment went fine with little complications. Below are screenshots<br><br> <i>The program running in Eclipse</i>
