# DAT250_Assignment1

## Technical 
This assignment went fairly well, except for the last few downloads. Downloading IntelliJ, JDK and Maven went fine, however I am uncertain whether I downloaded Maven correctly... The Heroku tutorial was very descriptive and nice so I think that went fine too, however when I came to mvn clean install it didnt work. So I had to use \.mvnw clean install, and had to use it everytime I wanted to push local changes. Problems also occured when I came to the database part. I haven't used postgresql in such a long time so when I downloaded it I couldn't find it and Heroku couldnt find postgresql downloaded on my computer. After much googling, I figured I should rather use Postgre.app instead of postgresql because its more user friendly and has all important packages. So I did that and then changed the path to find Postgre.app, then the database worked! Then another really frustrating problem occured. I wanted to push my code to github, but since I already wrote many git commits in the getting ready with Heroku guide it didnt want to push my code, since it was already pushed I think. So I tried to deploy using Heroku Git but it didnt work, I dont know why. 

## Validation
I checked that the software development is working with getting the results the getting-started tutorial said we should.
