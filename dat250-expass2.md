<h1>DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2</h1>

<h2>Experiment 1: Application using JPA</h2>

I found the tutorial quite difficult to follow. I experienced problems right at the bat when trying to load the project from git. I haven't used IntelliJ before so finding out how to load the project as a Maven project took some time! Then I had trouble with assignment 5 with changing the Todo class to Lombok. I got <i>"lombok.javac.apt.LombokProcessor could not be initialized"</i> as an error when running the project. Which was quite frustrating because I did have Lombok installed, and I tried many different things, including adding Lombok dependicies to pom.xml file and enabling annotation processing. But I think the error might be that Lombok doesnt support JDK higher than JDK 8!  


I couldn't figure out how to see the database I created.
