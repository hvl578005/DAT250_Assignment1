<h1>DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2</h1>


<h2>Experiment 1: Application using JPA</h2>

<h3>Assignment 4.3 - 5</h3>
I found the tutorial quite difficult to follow. I experienced problems right at the bat when trying to load the project from git. I haven't used IntelliJ before so finding out how to load the project as a Maven project took some time! Then I had trouble with assignment 5 with changing the Todo class to Lombok. I got <i>"lombok.javac.apt.LombokProcessor could not be initialized"</i> as an error when running the project. Which was quite frustrating because I did have Lombok installed, and I tried many different things, including adding Lombok dependicies to pom.xml file and enabling annotation processing. But I think the error might be that Lombok doesnt support JDK higher than JDK 8. Screenshot of the terminal in IntelliJ proving the database worked:

<h3>Assignment 6</h3>
This I found easier than the previous assignments. I had a bigger understanding of how IntelliJ worked and how to make Maven work. Screenshots of valid tests:

I couldn't figure out how to see the database I created.
